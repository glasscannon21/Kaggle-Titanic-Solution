Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
What particularly we need to do in this challenge?

In this challenge, we need to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy?

The data has been split into two groups:

- training set (train.csv)
- test set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build your machine learning models
The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data.
